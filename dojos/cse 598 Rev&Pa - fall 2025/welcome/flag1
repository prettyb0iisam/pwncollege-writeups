## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'cat /challenge/flag1'
copied the output in check_flag and put it in crackstation.net
obtained 'symbolic' (but in md5)
checked deeply the source code
found out the hashing function the code calls is still MD5 but 2x
put the output in crackstation separated in the middle:
7bf46ad61adc2265f803fc3b798b3559
ffc92c458b8c2fae185c283126663580
obtained correctly: 'symbolic execution'
-ran: '/challenge/flag1'
-typed: 'symbolic' or 'symbolic execution'
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
i think the source code is bugged but fortunately i could undestand anyway how the code works and obtained the flag
in this case it was just 2words hashed

## 🏁 Flag
