## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'cat /challenge/flag0'
found out the input would have been converted using MD5 hashing
this hash systems takes a string and return another string of 32chars hex every time
it allocates 16bytes into the stack and 33bytes into the heap.
digest -> 16bytes in which MD5 will create for each byte its own raw byte starting from each char of the string
digest_str -> 33bytes which is basically the digest but padded and the last byte is the \0
once md5sum function is done, it passes the output to check_flag which compare w/ 7de38f3c3d3baa7ca58a366f09577586
used online tools to reverse 7de38f3c3d3baa7ca58a366f09577586 and found out the input was 'secrets'
-ran: '/challenge/flag0'
-typed: 'secrets'
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
a lot about crypto and hashing systems
how MD5 works, but it is not considerate secure anymore cuz of collisions. 
those type of hashing systems r not reversable, it means u cannot obtaind the original input just from the output
in this case i was able to obtain the og input because there are online tools which can obtain the og input because the output is well known
https://crackstation.net/ allowed me to obtain the og input just from the output.
i checked it was right putting the output the website gave to me as input to https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/ specifying MD5 as operation
