## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'cat /challenge/flag-1.c'
the code asks for a string. it saves it to a variable called flag and then iterate to it.
for even indexes it xor with 1
for odd indexes it add 1
the final string should be: ixbhwewqlpfueo8l5mzbes0zoyycbmnd
using https://xor.pw/ i obtained the xor value for even indexes
using the ascii table i was able to subtract 1 to the character
password: hwcgvdvpmogtdn9k4l{adr1ynxxbcloc 
-ran: '/challenge/flag-1'
-typed: 'hwcgvdvpmogtdn9k4l{adr1ynxxbcloc'
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
it helps understanding deeply how program analysis works and rev
at first i was trying to copy the source code to a new file and removing the for loop responsable for password validation
i compiled the new file, bypassed successfully password encryption but could not able to open the flag file because of permissions
so the only way was running the elf from /challenge/flag-1 and since the code is read-execute only i was not able to remove the for loop preventing me from code manipulation
the only way was giving the code the right password
