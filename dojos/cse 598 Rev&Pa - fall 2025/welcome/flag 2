## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'ls -la /challenge'
could not find the source code of flag2
-ran: 'cat /challenge/.init'
found out the flag2.c file was removed
-ran: 'cat /challenge/flag2'
found a string inside all the not readable chars: 'what_a_l0vely_day'
i could have used also another command to find the string: 'strings /challenge/flag2'
-ran: '/challenge/flag2'
-typed: 'what_a_l0vely_day'
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
even if u do not have the original elf's source code, u can use strings or cat the elf file to check for ascii chars sequences
in this case the password was harcoded inside the file w/out being obfuscated
