## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'cat /challenge/sql'
found out the code creates a DBMS w/ sqlite. the class is TemporaryDB() and it will be for the rest of the challenges in this module.
our DBMS is db and the code adds values to it using db.execute()
the crucial line is:
'db.execute("""CREATE TABLE payloads AS SELECT ? as info""", [open("/flag").read().strip()])'
TABLE = payloads  COLUMN = info  RECORD (just one) = [flag]
-ran: '/challenge/sql'
-typed: 'SELECT info FROM payloads'
-flag popped out
