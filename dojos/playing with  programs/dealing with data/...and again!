## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'cat /challenge/runme'
-copied the password
-ran: 'echo "ianzwuxn" | /challenge/runme'
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
the challenge works the same as the prevoius one
in this case i tried echo "[PASSWORD]" instead of first running the file and second entering the password
the key difference is echo wont insert \n at the end of input
