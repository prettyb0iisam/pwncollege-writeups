---

## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'cat /challenge/runme'
found out the challenge works the same as previous one but in this case askes for more data
took the follow input: \xbe\xb0\x9b\x9e\xe9\xcf\xe3\xbc and removed every \x and pass it as input to the code
i was trying to do: 'echo -n "\xbe\xb0\x9b\x9e\xe9\xcf\xe3\xbc" | sed "s/\x//g" > bro'
and then copying the data inside bro and pasted when the code asks for password but idk why is not working
-ran: '/challenge/runme'
-typed: 'beb09b9ee9cfe3bc'
-flag popped out
