## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'cat /challenge/runme'
understood the loop and wrote a script which works exactly the opposite to obtain the correct password
copied the password
-ran: 'vim bro'
-typed: '#!/usr/bin/env python3'
        'from pwn import *'
        'context.log_level = 'error''
        'p = process("/challenge/runme")'
        'password = b"\xf7\xc5\xd6\xe4\xc9\xae\xdd\xe9"'
        'password = int.from_bytes(password, byteorder="big")'
        'password = bin(password)'
        'payload = str.encode(password)'
        'payload = payload[2:]'
        'p.write(payload)'
        'result = p.readall()'
        'print(result.decode('utf-8'))'
-ran: 'chmod a+x bro'
-ran: './bro'
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
coding in python is such beautiful (but im pretty sure i will regret what i've just written)
the key difference in this challenge is the code works at entered_password level not correct_password level
in the previous challenge the loop was working at correct_password level, 
it means that from the original input the loop would have create the expected
output and then compare it to entered password meaning that our script should have just replicate the loop
since here it works at entered_password level, to obtain the right original input we r supposed to enter, we need to reverse the entire loop
so:
from bytes.decode to str.encode
from int() to bin()
from int.to_bytes to int.from_bytes()
payload[2:] allowed me to delete the first two chars
