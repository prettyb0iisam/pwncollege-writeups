# challenge: binary and hex encoding

## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'cat /challenge/runme'
found out the code asks for input and manipulates it
the input's type is bytes because of sys.stdin.buffer.read1()
it goes in this way:
BYTES -> STR -> STR(hex) -> BYTES
and ultimately compare it w/ correct_password (b"\x8d")
-ran: '/challenge/runme'
-typed: '8d' -> this will add \n at the end -> '8d\n'
or i could have done this also: 'echo -n "8d" | /challenge/runme'
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
strings in python can be distinct in 2 types: BYTES or STR
bytes has b in front
str r just strings in unicode while BYTES r raw bytes
entered_password = sys.stdin.buffer.read1() -> BYTES
bds = BYTES -> DECODE -> STRINGS
seb = STRINGS -> ENCODE -> BYTES
entered_password.decode("l1") -> STRINGS
bytes.fromhex() -> BYTES (from hex str)
