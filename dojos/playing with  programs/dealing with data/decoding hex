# challenge: decoding hex

## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'cat /challenge/runme'
found out the process the code does is the same as previous challenges:
asks for input as BYTES
BYTES -> STR -> STR (hex) -> BYTES  ->confront w/ correct_password
in this caso tho to obtain the correct og input i reversed the sequence and used 'c8b4b9bafce9bec6' as input
b'c8b4b9bafce9bec6' -> 'c8b4b9bafce9bec6' -> '\xc8\xb4\xb9\xba\xfc\xe9\xbe\xc6' -> b'\xc8\xb4\xb9\xba\xfc\xe9\xbe\xc6'
so this means the right input is '\xc8\xb4\xb9\xba\xfc\xe9\xbe\xc6'
at first i tryed to put it as input once the code asks for password but it was incorrect, reading 33bytes
i found out that i had to being able make echo read escapes symbols from input so i used the -e flag in echo
-ran: 'echo -ne "\xc8\xb4\xb9\xba\xfc\xe9\xbe\xc6" | /challenge/runme'
-flag popped out

decided to write python code for the first time since the challenge suggests me to do it:
ran: 'vim bro'
-typed: '#!/usr/bin/env python3'
        'from pwn import *'
        'context.log_level = 'error''
        'p = process("/challenge/runme")'
        'payload = b"\xc8\xb4\xb9\xba\xfc\xe9\xbe\xc6"'
        'p.write(payload)'
        'result = p.readall()'
        'print(result.decode('utf-8'))'
-ran: 'chmod a+x bro'
-ran: './bro'
-flag popped out


the perfect code for this challenge is the following tho:

#!/usr/bin/dev python3
from pwn import *
context.log_level = 'error'

p = process("/challenge/runme")

password = b"c8b4b9bafce9bec6"

password = bytes.decode(password)

payload = bytes.fromhex(password)

p.write(payload)

result = p.readall()

print(result.decode.('utf-8'))


## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
the -e flag in echo, will allow echo to read escape symbols properly
best way to solve those type of challenges is python
bytes.decode -> from BYTES to STRING
bytes.fromhex -> from STR (in base hex) to BYTES
p.write(payload) run the process and sends the payload as input to it
p.readall will read every line in stdout
