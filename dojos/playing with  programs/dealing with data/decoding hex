## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'cat /challenge/runme'
found out the process the code does is the same as previous challenges:
asks for input as BYTES
BYTES -> STR -> STR (hex) -> BYTES  ->confront w/ correct_password
in this caso tho to obtain the correct og input i reversed the sequence and used 'c8b4b9bafce9bec6' as input
b'c8b4b9bafce9bec6' -> 'c8b4b9bafce9bec6' -> '\xc8\xb4\xb9\xba\xfc\xe9\xbe\xc6' -> b'\xc8\xb4\xb9\xba\xfc\xe9\xbe\xc6'
so this means the right input is '\xc8\xb4\xb9\xba\xfc\xe9\xbe\xc6'
at first i tryed to put it as input once the code asks for password but it was incorrect, reading 33bytes
i found out that i had to being able make echo read escapes symbols from input so i used the -e flag in echo
-ran: 'echo -ne "\xc8\xb4\xb9\xba\xfc\xe9\xbe\xc6" | /challenge/runme'
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
the -e flag in echo, will allow echo to read escape symbols properly

## 🏁 Flag
