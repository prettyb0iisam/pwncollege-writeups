## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'find / -maxdepth 1 -name "flag" -type f | cpio -o > bro.cpio'
-ran: 'cat bro.cpio'
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
cpio is a command to create archive as tar and zip
the key difference stands on how to pass files and create archives
cpio needs the file to be passed as standard inputs, this means using pipes
cpio -o
-v -> verbose, display files archived or extracted
-i -> extract archive

find command does a recursive search on each dir from the current working dir
to avoid this use -maxdepth flag N to specify how deep u want find to works
