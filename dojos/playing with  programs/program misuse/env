## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'env cat /flag'
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
how to pass root privileges to others commands
in this case env has SUID active, this means everytime u run it has root privileges
the first env's argument recieve privileges if env is root
in this case cat can cat the flag bc it has privileges
i could have done also:
env chmod a+r /flag; cat /flag

## 🏁 Flag
