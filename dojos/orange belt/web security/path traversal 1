## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'cat /challenge/server'
found out the only enpoint provided by the server is /deliverables
furthermore, the server allows anything after /deliverables/ allowing us for a path traversal
the server build the requested path in the following way:
-app.root_path = /challenge
-"/files/"
-path = everything after /deliverables in the url
requested_path = /challenge/files/???
if nothing is provided after /deliverables, by default it will use index.html
-ran: '/challenge/server'
-ran: 'nc -v challenge.localhost 80'
-typed: 'GET /deliverables/../../flag HTTP/1.1'
        'Host: challenge.localhost'
the requested_path=/challenge/files/../../flag is resolved in -> /flag    (../../ eliminates /challenge and /files)
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
how to read server's code and retrieve the correct vulnerablity to exploit
in this case <path:path> accepts arbitrary subpaths
app.root_path is the full path in which server's code exist
