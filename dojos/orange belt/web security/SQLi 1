## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
how to perform a basic SQLi
in this case u just need to add OR 1=1 -- in the pin field
  1-pin field is our target and not login-name because the session cookie the server builds is based on username. this means username=admin
  2-pin number is impossible to guess but lookin at the query, the structure is vulnerable and we can inject our payload
  3-the statemen OR 1=1 is always TRUE and this will make the query execute because it didnt fail
  4-the order of query checking conditions is: NOT -> AND -> OR. in this case it will do this:
    (username=admin AND pin=1) OR 1=1 --
    pin is wrong making the first condition FALSE but 1=1 makes it TRUE thanks to the OR
  5- to escape the last ' use -- to comment them out
once get the cookie session, u just need to make a GET request including the cookie
