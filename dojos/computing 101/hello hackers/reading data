## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: '/challenge/check'
-typed: '.intel_syntax noprefix'
        '.global _start'
        'start: '
        'mov rax, 0'
        'mov rdi, 0'
        'mov rsi, 1337000'
        'mov rdx, 8'
        'syscall'
        'mov rax, 1'
        'mov rdi, 1'
        'mov rsi, 133700'
        'mov rdx, 8'
        'syscall'
        'mov rax, 60'
        'mov rdi, 42'
        'syscall'
-pressed Ctrl+D
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
the read syscall takes the following arguments:
rax -> syscall number which is 0
rdi -> file descriptor
rsi -> memory address where data will be stored
rdx -> number of bytes to read from input
w/ read u can store input from stdin directly into memory at a specific address
in this case we dont need to write anything in the terminal after we r done w/ writing the program because automatically it will fill the stdin
