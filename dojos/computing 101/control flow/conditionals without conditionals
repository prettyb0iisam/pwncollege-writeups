## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'gdb /challenge/reverse-me'
(gdb): starti
(gdb): disas _start
the program takes the first arg pointer and puts it in rcx
then it dereferences it by storing the actual value (argv[1] actual value) in AL after cleaning rax
it will use this value in the jump_table to load and address and jump into it
here since it loads only AL it means its only 1byte=256possibilities in the jump table
(gdb): x/256a jump_table
it prints out the full jump_table
BUT IT HAS 2ENTRIES FOR EACH RAW
copied the raw with success: 
address - value
0x4013a5 - 0x401013
so the goal it select a value for rax that based on the jump_table 'functions', the result will be: 0x4013a5
0x4013a5-0x401085=0x320
0x320/0x8=0x64
0x64 = 100 = 'd'
(gdb): q
-ran: '/challenge/reverse-me d'
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
MOST OF THE TIME x COMMAND IN gdb PRINTS 2 ENTRIES FOR EACH ROW
this thing drove me crazy cuz i was thinking for each row only 1entry
values we pass to the programs as arguments r strings in memory
