## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
its been couple months i wasnt solving assembly challenges and shit this helps me solidify concepts
when u ran a program in linux x86_64, rsp points to the first 8bytes of the stack
those bytes contains how many args has passed to the program
then every 8bytes after contains pointers to:
-argv[0] -> program's name
-argv[1] -> first argument passed to the program
-argv[2] -> second argument ...
...
example:
./bro broski brodi
argc = 3
argv[0] -> pointer to program's name: "./bro"
argv[1] -> pointer to first arg: "broski"
argv[2] -> pointer to first arg: "brodi"
