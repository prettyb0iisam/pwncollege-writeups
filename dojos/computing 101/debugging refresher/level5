## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: '/challenge/embryogdb_level5'
-(gdb): set disassembly-flavor intel
-(gdb): disas main
the program works the same as before one but its going to ask for the random value 8 times.
obviusly we can do it manually but the goal is to script it
the value has been put in the stack so we need to dump it before the program asks for the random value
line main+716 print that the value has been set so we can break at that line or before one
-(gdb): q
-ran: 'vim bro.gdb'
-typed: 'r'
        'break *main+709'
        'commands'
          'set $value=*(long*)($rbp-0x18)'
          'printf "VALUE= %lx\n", $value'
          'c'
        'end'
        'c'
-ran: 'chmod a+x bro.gdb'
-ran: '/challenge/embryogdb_level5 -x bro.gdb'
-copied the value printed and pasted it (8x)
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
how to script w/ gdb
the lines r the commands that u use inside gdb
create a variable is crucial and u can do that using set 
remember that if u do not cast a value, it will be integer as default, so in this case u have to cast it to a long
then when u print it use l
