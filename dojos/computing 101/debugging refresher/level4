# challenge: level4

## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: '/challenge/embryogdb_level4'
-(gdb): set disassembly-flavor intel
-(gdb): disas main
we can see the program works the same as level3 but is going to check for the random values 4 times
in line main+626 there is the cmp so the goal is to verify which of the 2 regs our value will go
-(gdb): break *main+626
-(gdb): r
-(gdb): c
-typed: '1' -> wrong answer
-(gdb): info registers
our value is stored in rdx and the random one in rax (as before)
-(gdb): disas main
-(gdb): break *main+524
so we need to dump the value in the stack, rbp-0x18, after the program set it
-(gdb): info break
-(gdb): delete 1
-(gdb): r
-(gdb): c
-(gdb): x/gx $rbp-0x18
-copied the value
-(gdb): c
-pasted the value
correct answer
-(gdb): x/gx $rbp-0x18
-copied the value
-(gdb): c
-pasted the value
correct answer
-(gdb): x/gx $rbp-0x18
-copied the value
-(gdb): c
-pasted the value
correct answer
-(gdb): x/gx $rbp-0x18
-copied the value
-(gdb): c
-pasted the value
correct answer
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
the challenge works the same as level3 but wont ask the value only one time but 4 times
shotout to bidenator who i found in pwn.college's discord break room who helped me w/ this one. it was random
the command layout regs is so usefull to see the regs and memory while executing
