## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
how to perform jump
in this case, absolute jump
u need only to put the address which u want to start the instruction into a register and then call jmp w/ that register
here it is also an indirect jump beacuse first u put the address into a register and then perform jump
instructions as jump are saved in a specific memory zone: .text
