## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
modern CPUs use the x86-64 architecture (64-bit), which is backward compatible w/ x86 (32-bit)
u interact w/ the CPU via Assembly Instructions, which move and manipulate data in registers
rax is one of the general-porpuse 64-bit registers in x86-64
u store a value into a register using mov and separate the two operands w/ a comma
the program crashed because it only moved a value into rax but didn’t include any instruction to stop or exit
