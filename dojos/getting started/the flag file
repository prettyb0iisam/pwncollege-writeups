📁 getting started

## ✅ what i did  
-clicked on start
-opened the terminal
-executed '/flag' but i didnt have the permission
-executed '/challenge/solve' -> now i got the permission to read '/flag'
-ran: cat /flag
-flag poped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
running '/challenge/solve' make the file 'flag' readable (NOT EXECUTABLE).
u can see that now the file flag is readable lookin at its permissions running: ls -l /flag
