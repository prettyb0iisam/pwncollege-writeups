-ran: 'vim solve.sh'

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
u can decide the interpreter of ur file to be executed using shebang, 
a line of code at the top of the file
#!/bin/bash -> bash scripts
#!/usr/bin/python3 -> python scripts
#!/usr/bin/node -> node.js
finally i understand now why some files has that code line at the top:)
