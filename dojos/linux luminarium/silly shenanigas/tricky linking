## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'rm /tmp/collab/evil-commands.txt'
-pressed: 'y'
-ran: 'ln -s /home/zardus/.bashrc /tmp/collab/evil-commands.txt'
-ran: '/challenge/victim'
-ran: '/challenge/victim'
-flag popped out

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
how soft links actually work when executed
at first i removed evil-commands.txt because its first line contained a recursive remove that would delete system files
then i created a dynamic link from zardus' bashrc to the new /tmp/collab/evil-commands.txt
i ran /challenge/victim twice because at first it will write cat /flag to .bashrc and second it will execute it
