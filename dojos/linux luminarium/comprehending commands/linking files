## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
how to use soft and hard links in linux.
-soft link -> a link that points to another file using its path. if the original file is deleted or moved, the link will no longer works.
-hard link -> creates a new label (name) for the same inode (file content). the file is deleted when all the hard links r removed.
 
tl;dr
soft link: pointer to a path
hard link: pointer to the inode
