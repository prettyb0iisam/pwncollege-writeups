## ✅ what i did  
-clicked start
-opened the terminal
-ran: 'vim bro'
-typed: '/home/hacker/bro &'
        '/home/hacker/bro &'
-opened a new terminal
-ran in the new terminal: '/challenge/check'
-ran in the firt one: 'chmod a+x bro'
-ran: './bro &'
-terminal started showing DoS symptoms
-flag popped out in the other terminal

## 🧑🏾‍🏫 what this challenge teaches u
how to perform a local DoS attack by creating a fork bomb 
it recursively spawns child processes until the process table is saturated, making the system unable to start new processes and so the terminal unusable

this challenge and /silly shenanigas/sniffing input taught me an important lesson: 
if you struggle for hours, it means there’s still something fundamental you haven’t truly grasped yet
(yeah i know its obviously)
